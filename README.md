# Dive-Inn-Test
This is a practice site used for learning full-stack development. The code contained within is a mish-mash of styles and patterns, and should not be used as an example of a well-structured project (in my opinion), but is the result of the learning process.

Uses:
- Angular 10 + CLI
- RxJs, NgRx Store + Entity
- Express 4
- Node 12
- Pg-Promise
- Postgres 12
- Typescript 3.9, ts-node

Currently set up to host in Heroku
