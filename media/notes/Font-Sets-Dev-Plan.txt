1. What are the major pieces for getting CRUD operations working from Front End to Back End and back?

Front End
    UI - allows user to select operations
    Service - takes operation calls and sends to Server
    FE Model - converted useful object from API
    FE API Model - matches to BE API Model

Back End
    Server/API - talks to Services and DB to store data. Uses route-handling to talk to DB
    - define routes that can be used by FE (/api/fonts etc)
    - uses queries to talk to DB
    DB - stores data
    BE Model - matches to FE API Model and DB


2. What specific files would we need to create to get CRUD working for Font Sets?
  
  Components:
    Font-Set-Selector
    Font-Set-List    

  Services:
    Font-Set-Manager
  
  Models:
  FontSet.Model
    { 
      name: string,
      lastUpdated: Date,
      typeInstanceMap<type: string, instanceId: number>
      voteCount - future enhancement maybe
    }
  FontSetAPI.Model
    {
      id,
      set_id,
      set_name,
      fk_font_type_id,
      font_type_name,
      fk_font_instance_id
      last_updated (DATETIME ?)
    }

  Routes:
    FontSet GET - api/font/font-set
    FontSet POST - api/font/font-set/add
    FontSet POST - api/font/font-set/update
    FontSet DELETE - api/font/font-set/remove

  Queries:
    Select all font-sets
    Insert new font-set
    Update existing font-set
    Delete font-set
